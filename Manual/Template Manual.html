                    <h2>On the Subject of The Hypercolor</h2>
                    <p class="flavour-text">What do you mean two? there's only one hypercube!</p>

                    <p>This module has 16 icosahedrons each represents the vertex of a hypercube.</p>
                    <p>To solve this module, you have to press the correct vertex.</p>
                    <p>If you press the wrong vertex, a strike will be recorded and module will reset.</p>

                    <h3>Finding the vertex to press</h3>
                    <p>There will be 2 hypercubes with each vertex has one of the colors, which can be one of Black, Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, Magenta, Cyan, White</p>
                    <p>Only one color was assigned by a vertex while other colors were assigned by several vertices. The vertex which assigned that one color is the vertex to press.</p>

                    <h3>Getting each vertex's color</h3>
                    <p>Result of the addictive color mixing by each hypercube's vertex will be the corresponding vertex's color.</p>
                    <p>For the further information, see the reference below.</p>

                    <h3>Rotating both cubes</h3>
                    <p>You cannot identify each vertex's original color with only this.</p>
                    <p>Pressing the background will rotate both cubes with random direction. Get the color by rotating until you can identify the original color of each vertex.</p>
